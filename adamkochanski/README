The script process_RxCADRE_ignitions.m utilizes Jan's tools for processsing ignition data in order to generate ignition matrix for the RxCADRE burn L2F. 
There were 3 ATV ignition lines, but only 2 of them were GPS-ed and timed (ATV1 and ATV2). The third (most southern) ignition line is missing in 
RxCADRE dataset. The location and time of the 3rd ignition line was approximated based on the WASP IR fire observations, and the location of the
outhern burb plot boundary. The source kml data for the first two ignition lines, and the xls file with approximated locations and times of the
third (missing) ignition line are in fasmee/KML as L2F_Fire1.kml and L2F_Fire2.kml.
The script shoudl be executed from ./fasmee/janmandel directory so all the paths are set correctly. Otherwise go to fasmee/janmandel, execute
startup.m and then run the process_RxCADRE_ignitions.m.
In the current form the script processes ignition timing for a simulation starting at 15:00 UTC, so all tign matrices are in seconds from 15:00UTC.
If the simulation start time changes change:
	sim_start_h=15;
	sim_start_m=0; 
	sim_start_s=0;
